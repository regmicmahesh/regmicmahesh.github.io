				<h3 class = "subtopic-text"> Python </h3>
				<p>
				I can do full-stack web development projects in python.
				I am also practicing data science, and machine learning with python.
				I have experience with FastAPI, Flask and Django.
				I am exploring data science with pandas, matplotlib and studying
				machine learning, planning to migrate on golang with backend and 
				continue data science on python.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subtopic-text"> Javascript </h3>
				<p>
				I have worked a lot with javascript. I can design professional looking web-
				designs using React, planning to migrate to Vue. I've also worked with NodeJS,
				but I don't feel fun doing NodeJS projects a lot, as I hate javascript's 
				package management and configuration style. I've worked with ExpressJS, MongoDB
				and Prisma , but I'm Adonis kind of guy.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subtopic-text">Golang</h3>
				<p>
				I've been trying to learn golang lately, and trying to make some backend projects
				and enjoying the clean and fast coding in python. I've been trying to read some
				books and started to learn web-development, as I got inspired by @rwxrob. Pretty
				neatly, after some weeks, I'll be writing some interpreters in golang, as I got
				a book on it.

				<h3 class = "subtopic-text">BernHack</h3>
				<p>
				It was a fun and thrilling experience in winning bernhack. In this hackathon, we
				had created an android application using flutter which would recognize the items
				on the screen, using camera. We had used Azure SaaS, and our project was very
				impactful.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subtopic-text">CSITAN Workshop</h3>
				<p>
				I have given a workshop on CSIT Association of Pokhara on python programming
				basics. It was a great experience.

				<h3 class = "subtopic-text">Software Enginer Trainee [Enrolled]</h3>
				<p>I am currently enrolled / working as software engineer trainee at Insight
				Workshop, currently working on Django and slowly adapting react.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subtopic-text">Cloud Developer Apprentice [Enrolled]</h3>
				<p>
				I am working/learning at TechKraft as a cloud developer. Learning cloud was 
				one of my dreams, and it's fun and really smart to deploy and develop things
				on the cloud. I've been practicing AWS and Kubernetes a lot in this work.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "subtopic-text">Frontend Developer [Left]</h3>
				<p>I worked as frontend developer on HTML/CSS/JS stack in ManaKnight Digital
				for few months. I realized, I am not a frontend kind of guy and hated to do
				all those works. So, I left it pretty early.
